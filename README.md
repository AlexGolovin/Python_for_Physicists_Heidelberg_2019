# Python_for_Physicists_Heidelberg_2019

The goal of my lectures it to teach physics-students on the master and
PhD level how to efficiently and flexibly solve scientific programming
problems with the easy-to-learn, high-level programming language
Python.

## Preconditions for the course
I assume that participants of the course have some previous programming
experience with a language such as *C*, *Fortran* or *Java*. The most
important aspect is that you know *how to solve problems* with a
programming language.

- If you would like to brush up your programming / problem solving
  skills, you could consider some problems from
  [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/archives). ProjectEuler offers a
  great ressource for mathemtically oriented programming problems on
  all levels. With your prior knowledge, you should be able to solve
  problems 1-15 without too much effort in your favourite programming
  language.

- If you would like to learn some basic `Python` beforehand, I
  recommend the excellent, freely-available book
  [ThinkPython](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e//). Chapters 1-14
  contain topics that you should be familiar with in your programming language.

## Computer / Laptop setup
Each student will work actively with an own computer. As far as I
know, the Heidelberg computer pool offers enough computers for
all of you. You also can bring your own laptop and work with it. Necessary setup
procedures for own computers are described
[here](https://github.com/terben/Python_for_Physicists_Heidelberg_2019/tree/master/computer_setup).
If you bring your own laptop, please make sure that you have a working
*Python*-setup **before** coming to the first class!
