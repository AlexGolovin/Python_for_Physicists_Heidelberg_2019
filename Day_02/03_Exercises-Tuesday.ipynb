One approach is the following: Write three nested `while` loops iterating over the variables `m`, `n` and `o`. The variables represent the number of packages with corresponding pieces. `m` stands for the number of packages with 6 nuggets and so on. Within the innermost loop, you can check with an `if`-statement such as\n",
